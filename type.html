    Using a Supercharger is easy. You simply pull up, plug in, and in approximately 30 minutes you have enough range to get to your destination or the next station. All new Model S and Model X come standard with Supercharger technology.

Tesla Superchargers provide up to 170 miles of range in as little as 30 minutes.
Engineered for Performance
Supercharging takes advantage of Tesla’s unique battery architecture. Each battery's connections, cell chemistry, and cooling system are engineered to move significant power out of the battery pack during hard accelerations and uphill driving.

Driving (discharging) and charging use the same systems to move energy out of and into the battery. Supercharging utilizes the car's discharge capacity to flow a similar amount of power back into the battery pack through dedicated high voltage cables. The car’s onboard computer constantly monitors the battery during both driving and charging to ensure that it maintains peak performance.

Tesla is the only EV manufacturer capable of charging vehicles at up to 120 kW, which equates to about 170 miles of range in as little as 30 minutes. There are many factors that affect the actual charge rate, including ambient temperature, utility grid restrictions and charging traffic, amongst others.
